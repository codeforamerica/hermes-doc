        The defendant visits the court and is presented a court date that 
        needs to be attended.
      </p>
      <p>
        The defendant sees a poster or a card informing her of a court 
        reminder service (alternatively, her public defender tells her
        about the system).

    <li>
      <p>
        The defendant texts her case number to the system. The system
        should be forgiving, accepting input such as <code>13F0102292</code>
        or <code>13 F 102292</code>, and not requiring <code>-001</code>
        for co-defendant code.

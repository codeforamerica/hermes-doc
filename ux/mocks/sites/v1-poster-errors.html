          This doesn’t look like a case number. A case number
          looks like 13-M-0123456. Look at your files or ask your
          defender for a case number, and text it back.

      <h1>
        Correct case number, but wrong case

        The defendant texts her case number to the system, but the case doesn’t
        exist, is closed, doesn’t have any future court dates attached to
        it, or is a case against a company (not a person).

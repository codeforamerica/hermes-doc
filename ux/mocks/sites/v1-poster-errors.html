          This doesn’t look like a case number. A case number
          looks like 13-M-012345. Look at your files or ask your
          defender for a case number, and text it back.

      <h1>
        Correct case number, but no court date yet

      <p>
        The defendant texts her case number to the system. The case exists,
        but there is no court case assigned yet (or the assigned court case
        is today or in the past). We predict this will happen often.

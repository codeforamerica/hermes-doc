      The problem
    </h1>

    <img class='side' src='images/hall-of-justice.jpg'>

    <p>
      The criminal justice system is <em>complicated.</em> When citizens fail 
      to understand or comply with its orders they put themselves at risk of 
      entering a <em>cycle of trouble.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Most defendants see a judge for only a few minutes at a time and it’s 
      easy to be confused by proceedings. People are discharged from custody 
      with requirements for follow ups which, if not met, could result in 
      additional jail time. Individuals who miss court dates often have 
      warrants issued for their arrest, causing trouble for them and extra 
      work for administrators.

    <h3>
      To build a system helping people resolve their cases by reminding 
      them of upcoming court dates, providing helpful instructions, 
      and explaining consequences of the choices being made.

        The problem
      </h1>

      <p>
        The criminal justice system is <em>complicated.</em> 
        Most defendants see a judge for only a few minutes at a time, they
        might be confused by proceedings, and they are discharged
        with requirements for follow-ups.
      </p>
      <p>
        When citizens fail 
        to understand or comply with the orders, they put themselves at risk of 
        entering a <em>cycle of trouble.</em>
        Individuals who miss court dates often have 
        warrants issued for their arrest, complicating their lives,
        resulting in unnecessary jail time, and 
        adding extra work for administrators. 
      </p>

      <a href='images/complicated.jpg'><img 
        alt='Hall of Justice in Louisville, Ky.' 
        title='Hall of Justice in Louisville, Ky.' 
        class='left' src='images/complicated.jpg'></a>

      <p>
        The “user interface” to the criminal justice system consists mostly 
        of <em>hard-to-parse forms.</em> Outside of the Hall of Justice, 
        there is no single point of contact or place for citizens to inquire
        about their status and their next steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        When people fail to appear for court, <em>costs are incurred</em>
        in all parts of the criminal justice system. Missed court dates 
        mean judges, prosecutors, defense and support staff must re-process 
        a missed hearing; warrants must be produced; law enforcement must 
        arrest and transport defendants to jail; and the jail must book and 
        detain them. 
      </p>

        Our goal
      </h1>

      <h3 class='wide'>
        To build 
        a system that helps people resolve their cases 
        by reminding them of upcoming court dates, providing respectful
        and helpful 
        instructions, and explaining the consequences of the choices 
        being made.
        By using good technology and good design, we can help people stay 
        out of trouble by fulfilling their court-ordered responsibilities.
      </h3>

      <h1>
        Why this idea?
      </h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Nothing like this exists yet.</em>
          None of the current software in use addresses defendants’ needs 
          from their perspective, in a simple, respectful manner
        <li>
          <em>The ripple effect.</em>
          When defendants fail to appear in court, it affects judges, 
          prosecutors, defense attorneys, law enforcement, and 
          corrections. Decreasing failure to appear rates has the potential 
          to create efficiencies for all parts of the criminal justice system.
        <li>
          <em>Building upon prior research and contributing to it.</em>
          Existing research suggests that court date notification can 
          result in reductions in failure to appear rates. 
          We hope to work with the Arnold Foundation to build a pilot and 
          a product that learns from previous studies and helps to 
          further our understanding of what works. 
        <li>
          <em>Opening up the data.</em>
          In Kentucky, court date information is primarily stored in a 
          statewide database maintained by the Administrative Office of 
          the Courts (AoC). We hope to connect with AoC systems and pave 
          the way for other stakeholders to more efficiently use the wealth 
          of information contained in the central system. 
        <li>
          <em>Using modern standards and technologies.</em>
          We’re looking at this project as an opportunity to use and showcase
          modern technologies, open-source methodologies, 
          and data interchange standards.
        <li>
          <em>Reusability.</em>
          Failures to appear are a national problem. Our solution,
          if successful, could be replicated in other counties and states.
        <li>
          <em>Extensibility.</em>
          In the future, the system could be further extended to include
          more information (warrants, fees) and more functionality (involving
          family or community members).

        Specific goals and metrics
      </h1>

      <p>
        Failures to appear can impact victims and the willingness of witnesses to testify; 
        can result in longer jail
        stays for defendants on future offenses; result in loss of revenues 
        from unpaid fees and fines; add to frustration that“the system 
        “doesn’t work”; and undermine the integrity of the justice system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reducing FTA rates could help cut down 
        cost and time spent on low-risk offenders and allow for more resources 
        to be devoted to dealing with major issues and violent crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to <em>reduce the FTA rate to 15%</em> (from 18%) and
        <em>increase the defendants satisfaction with the system</em>.
      </p>

      <p class='todo'>
        TODO what metrics (metrics we know already – see above – metrics we
        don’t yet know) do we want to change?
      </p>
      <p class='todo'>
        TODO How specific we should be? Should we have a very deliberate 
        criteria of success? (E.g. reduce the 18% to 15% or something like this.)

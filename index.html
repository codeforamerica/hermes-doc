        The problem
      </h1>

      <a href='images/hall-of-justice.jpg'><img 
        alt='Hall of Justice in Louisville, Ky.' 
        title='Hall of Justice in Louisville, Ky.' 
        class='right' src='images/hall-of-justice.jpg'></a>

      <p>
        The criminal justice system is <em>complicated.</em> 
        Most defendants see the judge for only a few minutes at a time, 
        and are discharged with court-ordered requirements for follow-ups.
      </p>
      <p>
        When those orders are not understood or followed, the citizens risk 
        entering a <em>cycle of trouble.</em>
        Individuals who miss court dates often have 
        warrants issued for their arrest – complicating their lives,
        resulting in unnecessary jail time, and 
        adding extra work for administrators. 
      </p>

      <a href='images/complicated.jpg'><img 
        alt='Hall of Justice in Louisville, Ky.' 
        title='Hall of Justice in Louisville, Ky.' 
        class='left' src='images/complicated.jpg'></a>

      <p>
        The information that people receive is often
        written down on <em>hard-to-understand forms</em> or easy-to-lose 
        reminder cards. Outside of visiting the Hall of Justice, 
        there is no single point of contact or place for citizens to inquire
        about their status and their next steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        When people fail to appear for court, <em>costs are incurred</em>
        in all parts of the criminal justice system. Missed court dates 
        mean judges, prosecutors, defense and support staff must re-process 
        a missed hearing; warrants must be produced; law enforcement must 
        arrest and transport defendants to jail; and the corrections must book and 
        detain them. 
      </p>

        Our goal
      </h1>

      <img src='images/phone-mock.png' style='width: 300px; margin-top: -157px; float: right'>

      <h3 class='wide'>
        To build 
        a system that helps people resolve their court cases 
        by reminding them of upcoming court dates, providing respectful
        and helpful 
        instructions, and explaining the consequences of the available choices.
        By using modern technology and good design, we can help people fulfill
        their court-ordered responsibilities and stay out of trouble.
      </h3>

      <h1>
        Why this idea?
      </h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Nothing like this exists yet.</em>
          While some programs to remind people of court dates exist, they 
          are rare, use earlier technologies (such as postcards),
          or are not focused primarily on defendants.
        <li>
          <em>The ripple effect.</em>
          When defendants fail to appear in court, it affects judges, 
          prosecutors, defense attorneys, law enforcement, and 
          corrections. Decreasing failure to appear (FTA) rates has the potential 
          to reduce burden for all parts of the criminal justice system.
        <li>
          <em>Building upon prior research and contributing to it.</em>
          Existing research suggests that court date reminders can 
          result in reductions in the FTA rates. We are reviewing that 
          research, and we hope to collaborate on and learn from Arnold 
          Foundation’s upcoming pilot study that will test various variants 
          of court date reminders.
        <li>
          <em>Opening up the data.</em>
          In Kentucky, court date information is primarily stored in a 
          statewide database maintained by the Administrative Office of 
          the Courts. We hope to connect with AOC databases and pave 
          the way for other stakeholders to more efficiently use the wealth 
          of information contained in that central system. 
        <li>
          <em>Using modern standards and technologies.</em>
          We are looking at this project as an opportunity to use and showcase
          modern technologies, open-source methodologies, 
          and data interchange standards.
        <li>
          <em>Reusability.</em>
          Failures to appear are a national problem. Our solution will be
          built and documented to be easily replicated in other counties 
          and states.
        <li>
          <em>Extensibility.</em>
          In the future, the system could be further extended to include
          more information (warrants, fees), more functionality (supporting
          the involvement of family or community members), and more media
          (emails, Facebook messages, automated calls).
      </ul>

          Volunteers calling misdemeanor defendants and reminding them of 
          their cases 
          in 2006 resulted in <a href='http://www.thecourtbrothers.com/fta_repo/Coconino_County_court_hearing_notification_project.pdf'><b>4–19%</b> reduction</a> in the FTA rate.
        <li>
          <em>Jefferson County, Colo.</em> 
          The court notification volunteer calls
          in 2005 resulted in <a href='http://www.thecourtbrothers.com/fta_repo/Jefferson_County_6_month_summary.pdf'><b>52%</b> reduction</a> in the FTA rate.
        <li>
          <em>Lincoln, Neb.</em>

        <li>
          <em>King County, Wash.</em> 
          In 2000, volunteers calling defendants in Dictrict Court 
          resulted in
          <a href='http://cdm16501.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/ctadmin/id/437'><b>1–22%</b> reduction</a> in the FTA rate.
        <li>
          <em>Arapahoe County, Colo.</em> 
          The volunteer phone call system started in 2006 resulted in
          <a href='http://www.co.arapahoe.co.us/Departments/CS/JudicialServices/Court%20Date%20Notification%20Program.asp'><b>54-62%</b> reduction</a> in the FTA rate in 2009, and a corresponding “decrease of 6,839 jail bed days at an approximate cost of $68 a day, which translates into a savings of $465,052 of taxpayer dollars.”
      </ul>

      <h1>
        Specific goals and metrics
      </h1>

      <p>
        Failures to appear can impact victims and the willingness of witnesses to testify;
        result in longer jail
        stays for defendants on future offenses and loss of revenues 
        from unpaid fees and fines; add to frustration that “the system 
        doesn’t work”; undermine the integrity of the justice system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, <em>reducing FTA rates</em> is one of our two primary 
        objectives. It could help cut down costs and time spent on low-risk 
        offenders and allow for more resources to be devoted to dealing 
        with major issues and violent crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other primary objective is to <em>help citizens understand court 
        orders</em> and the processes of justice by providing easy-to-follow,
        customized, actionable instructions.
      </p>

      <h1>
        Challenges
      </h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Reaching to and understanding the defendants.</em>
          In order to build a system helping people, we need to understand
          them and their needs. 
        <li>
          <em>Issues of trust and social stigma.</em>
          How can we frame the collection of personal information (such as
          cell phone numbers or emails) in a way that’s effective and eases 
          the concerns about privacy?
        <li>
          <em>Choosing appropriate technology.</em>
          Our choice of text messages, email, Facebook, and/or a separate
          website will depend on defendants’ access to and understanding 
          of those technologies.
        <li>
          <em>Access interfaces to databases.</em>
          We need to architect a failure-proof, easy-to-maintain interface to 
          the existing databases.
      </ul>

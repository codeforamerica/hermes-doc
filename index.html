        The problem
      </h1>

      <a href='images/hall-of-justice.jpg'><img 
        alt='Hall of Justice in Louisville, Ky.' 
        title='Hall of Justice in Louisville, Ky.' 
        class='right' src='images/hall-of-justice.jpg'></a>

      <p>
        The criminal justice system is <em>complicated.</em> 
        Most defendants see the judge for only a few minutes at a time, and
        might be confused by proceedings. They are then discharged
        with court-ordered requirements for follow-ups.
      </p>
      <p>
        When citizens fail 
        to understand or comply with those orders, they risk 
        entering a <em>cycle of trouble.</em>
        Individuals who miss court dates often have 
        warrants issued for their arrest – complicating their lives,
        resulting in unnecessary jail time, and 
        adding extra work for administrators. 
      </p>

      <a href='images/complicated.jpg'><img 
        alt='Hall of Justice in Louisville, Ky.' 
        title='Hall of Justice in Louisville, Ky.' 
        class='left' src='images/complicated.jpg'></a>

      <p>
        The information that people receive is often
        written down on <em>hard-to-understand forms</em> or easy-to-lose 
        reminder cards. Outside of visiting the Hall of Justice, 
        there is no single point of contact or place for citizens to inquire
        about their status and their next steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        When people fail to appear for court, <em>costs are incurred</em>
        in all parts of the criminal justice system. Missed court dates 
        mean judges, prosecutors, defense and support staff must re-process 
        a missed hearing; warrants must be produced; law enforcement must 
        arrest and transport defendants to jail; and the corrections must book and 
        detain them. 
      </p>

      <h1>
        Our goal
      </h1>

      <h3 class='wide'>
        To build 
        a system that helps people resolve their court cases 
        by reminding them of upcoming court dates, providing respectful
        and helpful 
        instructions, and explaining the consequences of the available choices.
        By using modern technology and good design, we can help people fulfill
        their court-ordered responsibilities and stay out of trouble.
      </h3>

      <h1>
        Why this idea?
      </h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Nothing like this exists yet.</em>
          While systems to remind people of court dates exist, 
          we want our project to help the defendants resolve their cases
          by providing timely and relevant information in a clear, 
          respectful manner.
        <li>
          <em>The ripple effect.</em>
          When defendants fail to appear in court, it affects judges, 
          prosecutors, defense attorneys, law enforcement, and 
          corrections. Decreasing failure to appear (FTA) rates has the potential 
          to reduce burden for all parts of the criminal justice system.
        <li>
          <em>Building upon prior research and contributing to it.</em>
          Existing research suggests that court date notification can 
          result in reductions in the FTA rates. 
          We hope to work with the Arnold Foundation to build a pilot study and 
          subsequently a product that learns from previous studies and helps to 
          further our understanding of what works. 
        <li>
          <em>Opening up the data.</em>
          In Kentucky, court date information is primarily stored in a 
          statewide database maintained by the Administrative Office of 
          the Courts. We hope to connect with AoC databases and pave 
          the way for other stakeholders to more efficiently use the wealth 
          of information contained in that central system. 
        <li>
          <em>Using modern standards and technologies.</em>
          We are looking at this project as an opportunity to use and showcase
          modern technologies, open-source methodologies, 
          and data interchange standards.
        <li>
          <em>Reusability.</em>
          Failures to appear are a national problem. Our solution,
          if successful, could be replicated in other counties and states.
        <li>
          <em>Extensibility.</em>
          In the future, the system could be further extended to include
          more information (warrants, fees) and more functionality (e.g. supporting
          the involvement of family or community members).

      <h1>
        Specific goals and metrics
      </h1>

      <p>
        Failures to appear can: impact victims and the willingness of witnesses to testify,
        result in longer jail
        stays for defendants on future offenses and loss of revenues 
        from unpaid fees and fines, add to frustration that “the system 
        doesn’t work,” and undermine the integrity of the justice system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reducing FTA rates could help cut down 
        cost and time spent on low-risk offenders and allow for more resources 
        to be devoted to dealing with major issues and violent crime.
        In the pilot stage, we want to <em>reduce the FTA rate to 15%</em> 
        (from 18%).
      </p>
      <p>
        We will also explore ways to help citizens <em>understand court 
        orders and the processes of justice.</em>
      </p>

        Challenges
      </h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Accessing and understanding the defendants.</em>
          In order to build a system helping people, we need to understand
          them and their needs better. 
        <li>
          <em>Access interfaces to databases.</em>
          Architecting a failure-proof, easy-to-maintain interface to 
          the existing databases.
      </ul>

      <h1>
        Timeline
      </h1>

      <p>
        We will be working on this project throughout the fellowship 
        year, with the first pilot study happening in the Spring of 2013.
